# TabScore2

TabScore2 is a local web application that provides wireless scoring for the card game bridge.

TabScore2 is a work-in-progress development of TabScore.  It is written in C# and uses .NET 8 MVC; the Kestrel web server (as opposed to IIS); and implements dependency injection to separate out database access (in preparation for an anticipated upgrade from the antiquated Access 98 scoring database).  It also uses Bootstrap 5, and therefore all use of JQquery is being removed.

There is a TabScore website at: https://tabscore.infinityfreeapp.com/, where there are further information and downloads available.
