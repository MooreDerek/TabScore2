# TabScore2

TabScore2 is a development of TabScore that uses .NET 8 (or later); the Kestrel web server (as opposed to IIS); and implements dependency injection to separate out database access (in preparation for an anticipated upgrade from the antiquated Access 98 scoring database).  It also uses Bootstrap 5, and therefore all use of jquery has been removed.
