TabScore2 ReadMe file

TabScore2 is free and open source software that provides wireless scoring for 
the card game bridge.  It is a Windows desktop application that serves active
web pages across a local wireless network.  It requires a server PC, a local 
wireless network, and some sort of table-top device with a web browser on each 
table (tablet, phone, Kindle, etc). 

TabScore 2 uses the Bridgemate .bws standard Access database that is created by
the scoring program, so is a direct replacement for BridgeTab (or Bridgemate, 
BridgePad, etc).  Although TabScore2 has been built with EBUScore in mind, it 
should work with any bridge scoring program that can create a .bws database.

TabScore2 is designed for use on a PC with Windows 10+ and .NET 8.  Any 
Windows 10 PC, with latest updates from Microsoft, should have .NET 8 installed
automatically.  If not, this can be downloaded from Microsoft.

To upgrade TabScore2 from a previous installation, please read the section in
the User Guide on Upgrading TabScore2.

TabScore2 is currently limited to 4 sections (A, B, C and D in that order) and 
30 tables per section.  It can be used for pairs, teams, Swiss events, and  
individual events (provided the scoring program supports them).

TabScore2 can operate in 2 modes: Traditional Mode with one table-top device 
per table (like Bridgemate); or Personal Mode where the table-top devices
move with players.  Personal mode allows players to use their own tablets or 
phones, avoiding the need for bridge clubs to invest in expensive hardware.

TabScore2 implements a range of display options which can be set by the
scoring program, or from its Settings window.  See the User Guide for more
details.

TabScore2 is available in English, Spanish and German.  It will default to 
English if the Windows language is not supported.

TabScore2 uses Bo Haglund's Double Dummy Solver (DDS) to analyse 
hand records.  DDS requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x86) 
2015 (or later) to be installed on the PC.
